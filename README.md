# Vision
When designing course curricula, instructors face both a challenge and an opportunity to aggregate the wealth and variety of newly available educational resources into a cohesive structure for learning and assessment. At the same time, researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) have demonstrated many effective methods of supporting learners with automated intelligent feedback to both instructors and learners. However, scaling these systems can be challenging due to the intensive work necessary to record the knowledge in a manner that is usable by artificial intelligence systems.

We envision a joint solution to these challenges in the use of concept mapping for curricular organization. In our envisioned system, teachers have a method of organizing disparate materials and ensuring a holistic approach to their course design, which can be iteratively improved with automated intelligent feedback. Additionally, both teachers and students receive automated support including data analytics and visualization of student performance in terms of conceptual understanding, suggested topics of study/review, suggested learning materials, and suggested dynamic groups of students for productive collaborative learning
